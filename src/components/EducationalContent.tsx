      excerpt: 'Learn about the four phases of your menstrual cycle and what happens in your body during each phase.',
      content: `Your menstrual cycle is a natural process that prepares your body for potential pregnancy each month. Understanding these phases can help you better track your health and recognize patterns.

**Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):**
This is when you have your period. The lining of your uterus (endometrium) sheds, causing bleeding. You might experience cramps, fatigue, and mood changes.

**Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):**
Overlapping with menstruation, this phase involves the pituitary gland releasing hormones that stimulate your ovaries to prepare an egg for release.

**Ovulation Phase (Around Day 14):**
An egg is released from the ovary. This is your most fertile time. You might notice changes in cervical mucus and a slight increase in body temperature.

**Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):**
If the egg isn't fertilized, hormone levels drop, leading to PMS symptoms like bloating, mood swings, and breast tenderness.

Understanding these phases helps you:
- Plan activities around your energy levels
- Recognize when symptoms are normal
- Track fertility if trying to conceive
- Know when to expect your next period`,
